# MS_data_analytics
Codes and docs of my master degree in data analytics
The courses of my MS in data analytics include:
1. Information Structures with Python
   Description: This course covers the concepts of the object-oriented approach to software design and development using the Python programming language. It includes a detailed discussion of programming concepts starting with the fundamentals of data types, control structures methods, classes, arrays and strings, and proceeding to advanced topics such as inheritance and polymorphism, creating user interfaces, exceptions and streams. Upon completion of this course students will be capable of applying software engineering principles to design and implement Python applications that can be used in conjunction with analytics and big data
2. Quantitative Methods for Information Systems
   Description: The goal of this course is to provide Computer Information Systems students with the mathematical fundamentals required for successful quantitative analysis of problems in the field of business computing. The first part of the course introduces the mathematical prerequisites for understanding probability and statistics. Topics include combinatorial mathematics, functions, and the fundamentals of differentiation and integration. The second part of the course concentrates on the study of elementary probability theory, discrete and continuous distributions.
